# Snake_game

Snake game, the most famous game. Just behind pac-man and some others hahahaha ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£.
I decided to creat this game to pratice Python code. It's other simple game.
And, how the others code that I've beem created, all code is commeted!

So welcome and enjoy!

Ah, if you have some idea to become this game better, please comment.


Obs.: I had to use the **COURSES library**, and my Command Prompt is not recognizing it. Unfortunately I don't know how to solve this problem. Can you help me?
